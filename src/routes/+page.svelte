							Belated arrival of the Remnants of Ambition Urgent Quest leaderboard is now accepting
							submissions. Sorry for the delay! It was postponed in favor of Dark Falz Solus.
						</p>
						<p class="py-2">
							Since level 80 is coming soon, there might be a chance that you have runs from the
							level 75 patch era. If this applies to you, make a note in your run notes or contact a
							moderator on Discord and we will take care of the patch.
						</p>
						<strong>‚Üó Patch Level 80 (October 11, 2023)</strong><br />
						<p class="py-2">
							Level 80 will be arriving on Oct 11, so we will increase the patch code to level 80.
							If you have any runs from prior to level 80 please let us know on discord and we can
							adjust your patch level as appropriate.
						</p>
						<p class="py-2">
							Additionally, the game will also change the maximum time for duel quests quest from
							5min -&gt; 10 minutes, nullify region mag effects, and "HP of enemies has been
							lowered". We are not exactly sure at this time how it will effect new submissions to
							the bosses but we will play by ear and adjust accordingly.

						<strong>‚öî New Duel Boss Zelvin (October 18, 2023)</strong><br />

							<strong>üöö Data Migrations Complete</strong><br />
							<p>
								In order to implement new quests and categories at a faster and more maintainable
								rate we consolidated all the run data and player data on our backend database. These
								migrations have been completed as of August 17, 2023.
							</p>
							<div class="pt-2">
								With the new data infrastructure in place we had to add additional changes to
								submissions so that all runs from all quests+categories are consistent. These are:
								<div class="my-2 pl-2">
									<p>
										1. Player entries no longer require a server region. The server region that the
										run was executed is per run instead of by player "one". With that, all runs on
										the leaderboard have been assigned a run region (japan/global) based on evidence
										in your run's video (usually by fan translation distinction) if they have not
										before.
									</p>
									<p>
										2. Runs tied by time (1 second precision) are awarded the same rank. Times
										submitted earlier will still be ordered on first within the same time.
									</p>
									<p>
										3. We did not have "submission dates" for runs in the early days of the
										leaderboard. If your run was fairly old, we went by the youtube video's
										publication date.
									</p>
									<p>4. It is now optional to provide a server region in your profile (ARKS ID).</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p class="pt-2">
								Moving forward we hope to implement more run quests (e.g., Venogia UQ) and be able
								to adapt to new updates from SEGA as they happen.
							</p>
							<p class="pt-2">
								As usual if there are issues or inaccuracies please contact us on
								<a
									href="https://discord.com/invite/fFtEEJHuFp"
									target="_blank"
									rel="noreferrer noopener"
									class="link-primary link no-underline">Discord <i class="bi bi-discord" /></a
								> and we can get your run updated. Thank you for your patience.
