		On December 4th we will be getting a major class balance update focused on the Force class.
		Following, new 12-star Twaalv series will release on December 18th. This new series will also
		include new EX augments. Ruine Masquerader is expected to arrive next month in January so we
		will likely prepare a leaderboard for that update when it comes. Have a happy holiday! 🎅
