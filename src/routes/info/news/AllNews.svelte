	<NewsSection sectionTitle="🤖 Venogia Leaderboard (October 1, 2023)">
		Belated arrival of the Remnants of Ambition Urgent Quest leaderboard is now accepting
		submissions. Sorry for the delay! It was postponed in favor of Dark Falz Solus.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		Since level 80 is coming soon, there might be a chance that you have runs from the level 75
		patch era. If this applies to you, make a note in your run notes or contact a moderator on
		Discord and we will take care of the patch.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection sectionTitle="↗ Patch Level 80 (October 11, 2023)">
		Level 80 will be arriving on Oct 11, so we will increase the patch code to level 80. If you have
		any runs from prior to level 80 please let us know on discord and we can adjust your patch level
		as appropriate.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		Additionally, the game will also change the maximum time for duel quests quest from 5min -&gt;
		10 minutes, nullify region mag effects, and "HP of enemies has been lowered". We are not exactly
		sure at this time how it will effect new submissions to the bosses but we will play by ear and
		adjust accordingly.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection sectionTitle="⚔ New Duel Boss Zelvin (October 18, 2023)">

<HomeNews publicationDateIso="2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z" title="Leaderboard 3.2.3 Update">
	<NewsSection sectionTitle="🚚 Data Migrations Complete">
		In order to implement new quests and categories at a faster and more maintainable rate we
		consolidated all the run data and player data on our backend database. These migrations have
		been completed as of August 17, 2023.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		With the new data infrastructure in place we had to add additional changes to submissions so
		that all runs from all quests+categories are consistent. These are:
		<ol class="ml-2 [&>li]:py-1">
			<li>
				1. Player entries no longer require a server region. The server region that the run was
				executed is per run instead of by player "one". With that, all runs on the leaderboard have
				been assigned a run region (japan/global) based on evidence in your run's video (usually by
				fan translation distinction) if they have not before.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. Runs tied by time (1 second precision) are awarded the same rank. Times submitted earlier
				will still be ordered on first within the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				3. We did not have "submission dates" for runs in the early days of the leaderboard. If your
				run was fairly old, we went by the youtube video's publication date.
			</li>
			<li>4. It is now optional to provide a server region in your profile (ARKS ID).</li>
		</ol>
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		Moving forward we hope to implement more run quests (e.g., Venogia UQ) and be able to adapt to
		new updates from SEGA as they happen.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		As usual if there are issues or inaccuracies please contact us on
		<DiscordContact /> and we can get your run updated. Thank you for your patience.

	<NewsSection sectionTitle="⏫ Patch Bump for Level 75 Release">
		All runs submitted from this point on will be considered part of the level 75 release patch.
		This patch brings about skill re-balances from June 7th's update, Rarity 9⭐ weapons, Dark Falz
		Aegis R3, and of course the level cap increase to 75.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection sectionTitle="⚠ New Time Submission Rules">
		<div class="[&>p]:py-2">
			<p>
				It has come to our attention that we need to have more consistent time measuring with
				regards to how times are submitted on our leaderboard. The new rule now requires the
				"remaining time" to be submitted instead of the usual (Time Limit) - (Time Remaining) =
				Submission Time. This is because if a timer shows 19:59/20:00, technically a whole second
				has not passed until the timer updates with a time of 19:58/20:00.
			</p>
			<p>
				The UI has been adjusted to reflect this so please take care. All submission categories now
				use this remaining time input system, however future quest content may utilize a different
				system so it is subject to change.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to make everyone's submissions more accurate and consistent so we also went through
				all Purple Trigger runs manually and issued a new time. In all cases everyone's time has
				either stayed the same or improved by 1 second by the new rule. Dark Falz Aegis (solo and
				party) and the Duel runs have not been affected yet and are still under consideration. If
				you have any questions or concerns contact us on our Discord.
			</p>
		</div>
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection sectionTitle="💄 New Submission Landing Page">
		The <a href="/submit">Submit a Run</a> page has got a new makeover with a new landing page. This
		will make it easier for us to implement quest specific logic and have more leaderboard categories
		in the future.
