	<NewsSection sectionTitle="🚚 Data Migrations Complete">
		In order to implement new quests and categories at a faster and more maintainable rate we
		consolidated all the run data and player data on our backend database. These migrations have
		been completed as of August 17, 2023.
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		With the new data infrastructure in place we had to add additional changes to submissions so
		that all runs from all quests+categories are consistent. These are:
		<ol class="ml-2 [&>li]:py-1">
			<li>
				1. Player entries no longer require a server region. The server region that the run was
				executed is per run instead of by player "one". With that, all runs on the leaderboard have
				been assigned a run region (japan/global) based on evidence in your run's video (usually by
				fan translation distinction) if they have not before.
			</li>
			<li>
				2. Runs tied by time (1 second precision) are awarded the same rank. Times submitted earlier
				will still be ordered on first within the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				3. We did not have "submission dates" for runs in the early days of the leaderboard. If your
				run was fairly old, we went by the youtube video's publication date.
			</li>
			<li>4. It is now optional to provide a server region in your profile (ARKS ID).</li>
		</ol>
	</NewsSection>
	<NewsSection>
		Moving forward we hope to implement more run quests (e.g., Venogia UQ) and be able to adapt to
		new updates from SEGA as they happen.

		As usual if there are issues or inaccuracies please contact us on
		<DiscordContact /> and we can get your run updated. Thank you for your patience.

		Aegis R3, and of course the level cap increase to 75.

	<NewsSection sectionTitle="⚠ New Time Submission Rules">
		<div class="[&>p]:py-2">
			<p>
				It has come to our attention that we need to have more consistent time measuring with
				regards to how times are submitted on our leaderboard. The new rule now requires the
				"remaining time" to be submitted instead of the usual (Time Limit) - (Time Remaining) =
				Submission Time. This is because if a timer shows 19:59/20:00, technically a whole second
				has not passed until the timer updates with a time of 19:58/20:00.
			</p>
			<p>
				The UI has been adjusted to reflect this so please take care. All submission categories now
				use this remaining time input system, however future quest content may utilize a different
				system so it is subject to change.
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to make everyone's submissions more accurate and consistent so we also went through
				all Purple Trigger runs manually and issued a new time. In all cases everyone's time has
				either stayed the same or improved by 1 second by the new rule. Dark Falz Aegis (solo and
				party) and the Duel runs have not been affected yet and are still under consideration. If
				you have any questions or concerns contact us on our Discord.
